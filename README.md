## Prerequisites

* Android Studio 3.3.2 or higher
* Gradle 4.10.1+
* Gradle Plugin 3.3.0+
* For Android, Android 6 (Marshmallow)+

This project relies on platform functionality and libraries only present in Android 6+. Therefore, any project depending on RPC Provider with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) **must be an Android 6+ project**. Other rpc providers, however, can be created to support earlier Android versions or other platforms. If your project requires earlier Android version or alternate platform support, or if you'd like to create a rpc provider and have questions, please reach out to us by [logging an issue](/../../issues/new).

## Installation

RPC Provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) as a provider plugin.

To use RPC Provider with EOSIO SDK for Java in your app, add the following modules to your build.gradle:

**TODO** This needs to be updated when the distribution strategy is finalized.

```groovy
implementation 'one.block:eosio-java:0.1-alpha'
implementation 'one.block:eosio-java-android-rpc-provider:0.1-alpha'
```

You must also add the following to the `android` section of your application's build.gradle:

```groovy
// Needed to get bitcoin-j to produce a valid apk for android.
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/darwin/libscrypt.dylib'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/freebsd/libscrypt.so'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/linux/libscrypt.so'
}
```

Then refresh your gradle project.

Now RPC Provider is ready for use within EOSIO SDK for Java according to the [EOSIO SDK for Java Basic Usage instructions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/tree/develop#basic-usage).

## Direct Usage

If you wish to use RPC Provider directly, its public methods can be called like this:

```java
// Synchronous call
EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl rpcProvider = new EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl(
                    "https://mytestblockchain.net/");
GetRawAbiRequest request = new GetRawAbiRequest("eosio.token");
GetRawAbiResponse response = rpcProvider.getRawAbi(request);
String abi = response.getAbi();
String abiHash = response.getAbiHash();

// Asynchronous call
final EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl rpcProvider = new EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl(
        "https://mytestblockchain.net/");
GetBlockRequest[] request = { new GetBlockRequest("25260032") };

AsyncTask<GetBlockRequest, Void, GetBlockResponse> asyncTask = new AsyncTask<GetBlockRequest, Void, GetBlockResponse>() {
    GetBlockRpcError getBlockError = null;
    @Override
    protected GetBlockResponse doInBackground(GetBlockRequest... getBlockRequests) {
        // Here we are on a background thread.
        GetBlockResponse response = null;
        try {
            response = rpcProvider.getBlock(getBlockRequests[0]);
        } catch (GetBlockRpcError err) {
            getBlockError = err;
        }
        return response;
    }

    protected void onPostExecute(GetBlockResponse response) {
        // Here we are back on the main thread and could update the UI.
        String blockId = response.getId();
        String blockRefPrefix = response.getRefBlockPrefix();
        // ...

    }
}.execute(request);
```
